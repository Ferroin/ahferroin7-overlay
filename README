Everything in here is stuff that had no exact equivalent in the
official Portage tree when I created it.  Some day I'll probably try
to get this stuff merged into the official tree.

Currently, the programs in this overlay are:
app-portage/disowned            A shell script to automate finding files that
                                aren't owned by any package.
sys-apps/btrfs-swap             An initscript to setup a swapfile on BTRFS
sys-apps/zram-swap              An initscript to setup swap on a compressed
                                ramdisk.
sys-block/iosched-ctld          A shell based daemon for configuring I/O
                                scheduling.
sys-block/tune-iosched          An initscript to fine tune block I/O
                                scheduling
sys-power/powertune             An initscript to enable various power
                                management features
sys-process/coremgr             Some simple configuration for secure
                                coredumps on production systems.
