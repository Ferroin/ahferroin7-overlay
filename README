Some of the stuff in here is stuff that I wrote myself and am to lazy
to put in it's won repo, other stuff is versions that aren't (or weren't
at some point) availible in the regular protage tree.

Currently, the things I've wrtten in here are:
app-crypt/efitools              Updated version relative to Portage,
                                due to the apparent lack of support from
                                the developers for getting the updated
                                ebuild in tree.
app-portage/check-reboot        Check to see if we've updated any of a
                                set of packages and thus need to reboot.
app-portage/disowned            A shell script to automate finding files that
                                aren't owned by any package.
app-portage/portage-tools-meta  Simple meta-package that pulls in
                                gentoolkit, eix, layman, and
                                smart-live-rebuild.
sys-apps/auto-swap              An initscript to do advanced swapfile
                                setup.
sys-apps/kdump-init             A simple (and somewhat naieve) initscript
                                to set up and run kernel crash dumps.
sys-apps/pymlock                A python script to mlock arbitrary files,
                                including an initscript to be used as
                                a replacement for memlockd.
sys-apps/vmlock                 A initscript intended to replace pymlock,
                                it uses dev-util/vmtouch for the actual
                                locking, and is more efficient overall.
                                Also includes a python script with the
                                file list expansion logic from pymlock.
sys-apps/zram-swap              An initscript to setup swap on a compressed
                                ramdisk.
sys-fs/fscleaner                A cron job to automate basic filesystem
                                maintnence tasks.
virtual/basic-system-meta       Pulls in some of the packages that most
                                other distros include by default, but
                                Gentoo doesn't.
virtual/phys-system-meta        Same as above, just adds more which are
                                normally only used on physical hardware
                                (instad of in VM's).
virtual/x86-system-meta         Same as above, just adds more which are
                                usually standard on x86 systems, but
                                may not be needed on others.

And this is a list of 3rd-party stuff:
app-crypt/efitools              Updated version relative to Portage,
                                due to the apparent lack of support from
                                the developers for getting the updated
                                ebuild in tree.
dev-python/nbt2yaml             A library and tools for converting

net-misc/dropbox                Custom dropbox ebuild to work around
