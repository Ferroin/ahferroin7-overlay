Everything in here is stuff that had no exact equivalent in the
official Portage tree when I created it.  Some day I'll probably try
to get this stuff merged into the official tree.

Currently, the programs in this overlay are:
app-crypt/efitools              Updated version relative to Portage,
                                due to the apparent lack of support from
                                the developers for getting the updated
                                ebuild in tree.
app-portage/check-reboot        Check to see if we've updated any of a
                                set of packages and thus need to reboot.
app-portage/disowned            A shell script to automate finding files that
                                aren't owned by any package.
net-misc/dropbox                Custom dropbox ebuild to work around
                                ncurses dependency issues
sys-apps/auto-swap              An initscript to do advanced swapfile
                                setup.
sys-apps/kdump-init             A simple (and somewhat naieve) initscript
                                to set up and run kernel crash dumps.
sys-apps/pymlock                A python script to mlock arbitrary files,
                                including an initscript to be used as
                                a replacement for memlockd.
sys-apps/vmlock                 A initscript intended to replace pymlock,
                                it uses dev-util/vmtouch for the actual
                                locking, and is more efficient overall.
                                Also includes a python script with the
                                file list expansion logic from pymlock.
sys-apps/zram-swap              An initscript to setup swap on a compressed
                                ramdisk.
sys-fs/fscleaner                A cron job to automate basic filesystem
                                maintnence tasks.
