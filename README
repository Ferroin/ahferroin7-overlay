Everything in here is stuff that had no exact equivalent in the
official Portage tree when I created it.  Some day I'll probably try
to get this stuff merged into the official tree.

Currently, the programs in this overlay are:
app-portage/auto-update         An automatic update script for portage.
sys-apps/zram-swap              An initscript to setup swap on a compressed
                                ramdisk.
