Everything in here is stuff that had no exact equivalent in the
official Portage tree when I created it.  Some day I'll probably try
to get this stuff merged into the official tree.

Currently, the programs in this overlay are:
sys-apps/iosched-ctld           A shell based daemon for configuring I/O
                                scheduling.
sys-apps/tune-iosched           An initscript to fine tune block I/O
                                scheduling
sys-apps/zram-swap              An initscript to setup swap on a compressed
                                ramdisk.
