# /etc/conf.d/backtrack
# Configuration file for backtrack

# DUMPLIST is a space delimited list of filesystems to dump
# Filesystems should be specified by absolute path to the underlying device
# As a general guideline, you probably want to include both your root
# partition and your boot partition here, as well as anything that has data
# on it that is not trivial to reproduce (/home for example).
#DUMPLIST="/dev/sda1 /dev/sda2"

# DUMPTIME specifies what time of day you want the backup to happen.
# It should be the Hour of the day in 24 hour format (midnight is 0, 11PM
# is 23).  Backtrack will automatically run the required dumps some time
# either during this hour or at the start of the NEXT hour.  We default to
# running at midnight.
DUMPTIME=0

# DUMPDEST specifies the location to store the dump files at, it must be
# an absolute directory path (not a device, tape, or URI).  It also should
# be on a filesystem that is NOT listed in DUMPLIST, otherwise you will end
# with dump dumping it's own dumpfiles, which is BAD.  A dedicated filesystem
# is also prefered, as this makes things easier to work with.
#DUMPDEST="/path/to/backup/storage"

# KEEPMONTHS specifies how many months worth of level 0 dumps (full backups)
# to keep.  Keep in mind that these will take up a lot more space than the
# weekly and daily backups, so you shouldn't set this number too high.
# We default to keeping 4 months worth, as that provides a good balance
# between recovery ability and disk usage.
KEEPMONTHS=4

# KEEPWEEKS specifies how many weeks worth of incremental dumps to keep
# We default to four weeks, as the monthly backups are full backups anyway
KEEPWEEKS=4
