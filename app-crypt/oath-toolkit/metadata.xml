the algorithms. For managing secret key files, the Portable Symmetric
Key Container (PSKC) format described in RFC6030 is supported.

liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

libpskc: A shared and static C library for PSKC handling.

pskctool: A command line tool for manipulating PSKC data.
