auto-update is intended to be an easy way to automatically manage system
updates on Gentoo.  Special handling is planned for as many of the special
cases as possible (updating portage first, running python-updater or
perl-cleaner when needed, etc.).

Other planned features include:
	* Using sys-process/at in addition to cron to schedule updates
	  when the system is not being utilized.
	* A standalone daemon with even more advanced scheduling options.
