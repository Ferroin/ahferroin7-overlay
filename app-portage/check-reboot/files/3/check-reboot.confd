# check-reboot configuration file
#
# This is used by both the init script and the command check-reboot
#
# The only variable is PKGS, which is a whitespace separated list of
# packages to check. If a listed package isn't installed, it will
# be ignored.
#
# If a package on this list was already installed when the system booted
# up, and the version has changed since boot up, then the `check-reboot`
# command will report a reboot as being required.
#
# In general, a package should be on this list if any of the following
# are true:
#
#   - It truly requires a reboot to upgrade, such as kernel images or
#     type-1 hypervisors.
#   - It's an out-of-tree kernel module that cannot be reasonably reloaded
#     at runtime.
#   - It's a library used by a very large percentage of the system.
#   - It's a service that cannot be cleanly restarted without rebooting.
#   - It's something involved in core system setup during boot and cannot
#     be cleanly reconfigured at runtime.
#
# The default list should work sensibly for a vast majority of systems.
