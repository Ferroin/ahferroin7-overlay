# /etc/conf.d/auto-swap
# Configuration file for auto-swap
#
# SWAPFILE is the path to the file to use.
# Note that the script forces the ownership to root:root and
# changes permissions to 600 for security.  Also, we set NODATACOW
# for efficency, and use truncate to set the file size (which means
# that space isn't allocated until it's actually used).
#SWAPFILE="/swap"

# SIZE is how big to make the swap file.
# If this isn't specified, then the file is made the same size as the
# ammount of detected memory
# The size is specified in megabytes.
#SIZE=64

# REMOVE is either 0 to leave the swap file during shutdown, or 1 to remove it
REMOVE=1

# USELOOP is used to determine whether or not to use a loop device.
# If it is set to 1, then we unconditionally use a loop device, if 0,
# then we never use a loop device.  If it is unset, the initscript will
# try to detect whether or not we need a loop device.  You should
# generally leave this unset unless the initscript makes the wrong choice
# by default.
#USELOOP=1

# ENCRYPT is used to configure dmcrypt based encryption of the swapfile.
# If it is set, then we use cryptsetup to encrypt the device.  Make sure
# that you have cryptsetup installed and your kernel has the dmcrypt module
# either loaded or built in before you use this, otherwise the initscript
# will die.
#ENCRYPT=1

# CRYPTOPTS is the list of options to pass to cryptsetup.  It defaults
# to "--cipher=aes-xts-plain64 --hash=sha1 --keyfile=/dev/urandom
# --keysize=512".  This shouldn't include --type, use CRYPTTYPE for
# that, and it shouldn't include --align-payload, as we compute that
# automatically.
#CRYPTOPTS=""

# CRYPTTYPE is the device type for cryptsetup.  It defaults to "plain".
#CRYPTTYPE="plain"
