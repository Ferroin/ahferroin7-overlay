# /etc/conf.d/btrfs-swap
# Configuration file for btrfs-swap
#
# SWAPFILE is the path to the file to use.
# Note that the script forces the ownership to root:root and
# changes permissions to 600 for security.  Also, we set NODATACOW
# for efficency, and use truncate to set the file size (which means
# that space isn't allocated until it's actually used).
#SWAPFILE="/swap"

# SIZE is how big to make the swap file.
# If this isn't specified, then the file is made the same size as the
# ammount of detected memory
# SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).
# Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (pow-
# ers of 1000).
#SIZE=64M

# REMOVE is either 0 to leave the swap file during shutdown, or 1 to remove it
REMOVE=1
