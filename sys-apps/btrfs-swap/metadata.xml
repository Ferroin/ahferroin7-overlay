This is a simple init-script to setup a swapfile on a BTRFS volume.
It sanely handles preallocating the file, and correctly handles setup
of the loop device that is needed for swap to work on BTRFS.  It can
also remove the file during shutdown, which is useful on SSD's and when
doing a filesystem balance.
