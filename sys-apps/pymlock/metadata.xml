	<longdescription>Pymlock is a simple python script for locking
	files into memory.  It is smart enough to detect executables
	and recursive map and lock the libraries they use into memory.
	The general intent is for this to be run through an initscript
	that daemonizes it and have it lock certain critical files
	into memory so that a system can still be accessed even if it's
	thrashing due to resource starvation.</longdescription>
