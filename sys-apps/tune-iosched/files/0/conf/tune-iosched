# /etc/conf.d/tune-iosched
# Configuration for tuning the I/O schedulers

# The general format is very simple, for each device in /sys/block,
# you can have a variable here named sched_device where device is
# replaced by the name of the link in /sys/block.  The device can also
# be set to all to specify it for all devices.  If set, this variable
# should have the name of the I/O scheduler you want to use for that device
# The options for this depend on what you have compiled into your kernel.
# The 3 schedulers in the mainline kernel are:
#       * cfq: A scheduler based on the same algorithm used in the process
#              scheduler, this is the default in kernels built with
#              genkernel.
#       * deadline: A simple C-SCAN based scheduler, this provides more
#                   deterministic read and write latencies, so it's better
#                   for devices that need realtime I/O preformance.
#       * noop: This is a simple option to specify to use no scheduler.
#               It provides better performance on devices that don't have
#               any seek latency (such as SSD's or other flash disks).
#
# For example, if your first disk is an SSD, uncommenting the following
# will probably improve I/O preformance to that disk.
#sched_sda=noop

# You can uncomment the following to set the deadline scheduler as default
# for devices you don't specify in this file.
#sched_all=deadline

# Additionally, you can define variables of the form cfq_device_parameter
# or deadline_device_parameter to specify the value to use for parameter
# on the given device with the given scheduler.  For info on the parameters
# that are availible, check the documentation in the kernel sources
#
# As an example, uncomment the following to disable CFQ low-latency mode on
# /dev/sdb, which can increase throughput at the cost of latency.
#cfq_sdb_latency=0

# The following will make synchronus requests higher priority relative to
# asynchronus requests, this may help performance of programs requiring sync
# access to data.
#cfq_all_fifo_expire_sync=62
