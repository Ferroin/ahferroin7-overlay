# /etc/conf.d/zram-swap

# This is an integer specifing which zram device number to use.
# It starts at 0 for the first device.
# When unset, we default to device 0.
# Unless you use compressed ramdisks for something else, you should
# use the default setting.
#DEVICE=0

# This specifies the size of the swap device in bytes.
# You can include a suffix of K, M, or G for kilobytes, megabytes, and
# gigabytes.
# When unset, we default to using 1/4 of the system memory.
# Note that this is the apparent size of the device, not the ammount of
# space it uses in memory.  The actual ammount of space will usually be
# a little more than half this value.
#DEV_SIZE=64M

# Use this to specify any parameters to pass to the zram module when it
# is loaded.
# Use num_devices to specify how many devices to create by default.
# If you don't use compressed ramdisks for something else, you should
# probably leave this empty.
#MOD_PARAMS="num_devices=4"

# Uncomment this if you want the module unloaded when zram-swap is stopped.
#UNLOAD_ZRAM="YES"
