This is a simple initscript to setup swapspace on a compressed ramdisk
using the zram kernel module.  Zram itself uses a redicullously fast
compression algorithm that on average reduces data size by about 1/3
(the compression is even better for swap pages cause they tend to have
a lot of repeats and runs of zeroes).  By default, we create a ramdisk
sized at 1/4 of the total ammount of system memory (this takes up about
1/8 of system memory when full).  Restarting the initscript will
reinitialize the ramdisk, freeing up any memory it may be using.
I've personally timed I/O to a zram ramdisk as being at least as fast
as the same I/O to a SATA III hard disk, and usually faster.

Please note that to use this, you need to be using a kernel built with:
	CONFIG_ZSMALLOC=y
and
	CONFIG_ZRAM=y
or
	CONFIG_ZRAM=m

Please also note that upstream (kernel.org) still don't consider this
to be production quality despite the large number of successful users.
As such, using the above configs marks your kernel as 'tainted', which
may make it harder to get support from kernel.org with respect to any
bugs you may find.
