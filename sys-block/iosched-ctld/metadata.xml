This is a relatively simple program to allow user configured tuning of
the block I/O schedkulers on linux systems.  It allows per-device tuning,
as well as tuning for hotplugged devices, and tuning based on certain
device parameters.  Individuals who use this should make a point to read
file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation/block/CFQ-iosched.txt and
file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation/block/Deadline-iosched.txt.
In general, the most common uses for this script are setting a noop
scheduler on SSD's, disabling CFQ's low-latency mode to boost throughput
on file servers, and using more sane settings than the default on high-end
storage devices (ie. RAID controllers).
