Fscleaner is a relatively simple cron job for preformaing maintnence on
a variety of filesystems.  It includes support for:
	* Running fstrim on a given set of filesystems
	* Running zerofree on a given set of filesystems
	* Defragmenting EXT4 filesystems
	* Balancing, scrubbing, and defragmenting BTRFS file systems

I plan to eventually also include support for the following:
	* Batch deduplication on BTRFs file systems
	* Balancing, scrubbing, and resilvering ZFS file systems
	* Preforming hardlink based deduplication in sspecific directories
	* XFS defragmentation using xfs_fsr
