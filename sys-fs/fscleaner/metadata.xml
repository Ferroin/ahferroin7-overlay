Fscleaner is a relatively simple cron job for preformaing maintnence on
a variety of filesystems.  It includes support for:
	* Running fstrim on a given set of filesystems
	* Running zerofree on a given set of filesystems
	* Defragmenting EXT4 filesystems
	* Balancing, scrubbing, and defragmenting BTRFS file systems

I plan to eventually also include support for the following:
	* Batch deduplication on BTRFS file systems
	* Balancing, scrubbing, and resilvering ZFS file systems
	* Preforming hardlink based deduplication in sspecific directories
	* XFS defragmentation using xfs_fsr

It can also be invoked directly, so you can use things other than cron
to determine when things happen.  It takes one argument, which specifies
which set of actions to run (daily, weekly, or monthly).
