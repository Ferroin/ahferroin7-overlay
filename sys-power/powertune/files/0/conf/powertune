# SATA_PM is the mode for SATA/SCSI Link Power Management
# This is one of:
#       min_power: for maximal power saving
#       max_power: for maximal performance
#       moderate_power: for moderate power savings with
#                       little performance impact
SATA_PM="moderate_power"

# PCI_ASPM is for control of PCI power management
# Leave it undevined or defined as an empty string
# to disable setting power management
# Define it with any value to enable power management
# This generally has little effect on performance, but can save a lot of
# power.
PCI_ASPM=1

# USB_PM is like PCI_ASPM, but for USB devices instead of PCI
USB_PM=1
