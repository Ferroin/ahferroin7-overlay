	<longdescription>This is a really basic metapackage to pull
	in some stuff which Gentoo doesn't include by default but
	is generally considered standard on almost every other big
	distribution of Linux (and most other UNIX derivatives).
	As of right now, it makes sure you have sudo, one of
	app-misc/screen or app-misc/tmux, iptables, a cron implementation,
	a syslog implementation, an mta, bc (this gets pulled in anyway by
	most kernel sources packages), logrotate, and a vi clone (defaults
	to vim, because that's what I use.  The general idea is that
	most people install this stuff (except possibly vi) anyway, so it
	should be easy to just pull it all in at once.</longdescription>
