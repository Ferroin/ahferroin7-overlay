	<longdescription>This is a really basic metapackage to pull
	in some stuff which Gentoo doesn't include by default but
	is generally considered standard on almost every other big
	distribution of Linux (and most other UNIX derivatives).  This
	adds on to virtual/basic-system-meta by pulling in linux-firmware,
	pm-utils, and a network time daemon (net-misc/ntp by default),
	all of which are standard on most other distros, but only really
	make sense on physical hardware.</longdescription>
