	<longdescription>This is a really basic metapackage to pull
	in some stuff which Gentoo doesn't include by default but
	is generally considered standard on almost every other big
	distribution of Linux (and most other UNIX derivatives).
	This builds on phsy-system-meta by pulling in mcelog,
	microcode-data, acpid, usbutils, pciutils, irqbalance, dmidecode
	and hdparm.  All of these are pretty standard on x86 systems,
	but not necessarily other architectures.</longdescription>
