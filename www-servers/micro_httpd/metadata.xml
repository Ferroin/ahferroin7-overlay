		micro_httpd is a miniscule HTTP/1.0 server designed to be
		run from inetd.  It's not high performance, but is more
		than adequate for very low-volume usage (simple testing,
		HTTP netboot, LAN file sharing, etc).

		It covers all the basic features expected of a minimalistic HTTP server:
		* Secure against '..' filename snooping.
		* Common MIME types
		* Training-slash redirection
		* index.html
		* Directory listings
